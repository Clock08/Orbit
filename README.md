Modified Baystation with a few ports/tweaks/additions. Oh yeah, and the rules make sense and our admins aren't shit.

### Current Development Model
Master Branch         -> What is currently being used on the live server

Development Branch    -> Where we are committing new ideas

Dev-Freeze Branch     -> Where we are bugfixing in prep for next release

When we feel that the Development Branch has enough content for the next release, we create a Dev-Freeze fork, and use that branch to focus solely on patching and balancing what is already there. When this process is finished, we merge Dev-Freeze into Master, and repeat the process.
